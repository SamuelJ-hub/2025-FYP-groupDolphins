def analyze_hair_amount(image, low_threshold_pct=3, high_threshold_pct=10):
    """
    Analyzes an image to estimate hair presence and categorizes it.

    It converts the image to grayscale, applies black-hat filtering to highlight
    hair-like structures, thresholds the result, and then calculates the
    percentage of hair coverage to assign a hair level (0, 1, or 2).

    Args:
        image (numpy.ndarray): The input color image (BGR format).
        low_threshold_pct (float, optional): Lower percentage threshold for 'some hair' (level 1). Defaults to 3.
        high_threshold_pct (float, optional): Higher percentage threshold for 'a lot of hair' (level 2). Defaults to 10.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary with 'hair_level' (0, 1, or 2) and 
              'hair_coverage_pct' (float percentage), or NaNs if input is invalid.
